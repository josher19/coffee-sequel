# Coffee-Sequel

Exploring options for adding SQL-like syntax to CoffeeScript

## Goals

1. Make it easier to use SQL-like commands in CoffeeScript to query Objects, Arrays, and JSON-stores
2. Design a pluggable architecture so that the underlying NoSQL or SQL database can be easily changed by changing one require file on the server side and a script src on the browser.
